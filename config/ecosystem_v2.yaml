# Ecosystem v2 - Resource-Driven Migration
# =============================================================================
# Focus on resource dynamics to create natural migration pressure:
#   - Slow resource regrowth forces prey to move after depleting an area
#   - Sparse resource patches (high contrast) create barren zones to cross
#   - Lower forage efficiency means prey must find more resources
#   - Moderate prey energy costs create real survival pressure
#
# The goal is meaningful resource depletion where prey must migrate to survive,
# not just coast on abundant food. Predator pressure emerges from prey behavior.
# =============================================================================

# Start with balanced population to prevent feast-boom cycle
population:
  initial: 300
  predator_spawn_chance: 0.015 # ~5 predators to start (let prey build up)
  min_predators: 0             # No artificial floor
  min_prey: 0                  # No artificial floor
  max_pred: 8                  # Very low cap - scarce apex predators

# Resource field - grazing parameters
resource:
  contrast: 1.8               # Lush patches - plenty of resources overall
  forage_efficiency: 0.85     # Slight inefficiency
  graze_radius: 2             # Larger depletion zone (5x5 kernel) - forces migration

# Energy costs - moderate pressure
energy:
  predator:
    digest_time: 1.5          # Faster hunting (default 0.8)
  prey:
    base_cost: 0.013          # Slightly lower than default 0.015
    forage_rate: 0.055        # Slightly above default 0.045
    grazing_peak: 0.20        # Optimal grazing at 20% speed (encourages slow movement)

# Refugia - protection tied to resources
refugia:
  strength: 0.75              # Strong protection in resource areas

# Breeding tied to actual resource success
reproduction:
  prey_threshold: 0.55        # Prey breed at moderate energy
  prey_cooldown: 6.0          # Faster breeding to recover from predation
  pred_cooldown: 30.0         # Very slow predator breeding
  pred_threshold: 0.92        # Predators need excellent hunting to breed
  pred_density_k: 400         # Stronger density dependence (halves at 400 prey)
