# =============================================================================
# Ecosystem v2 - Self-Sustaining Predator-Prey Cycles
# =============================================================================
# Achieves Lotka-Volterra-style oscillating coexistence through:
#   - Low prey energy costs (base 0.01, high forage 0.08)
#   - Low prey reproduction threshold (0.55) enabling frequent breeding
#   - Slow predator hunting (3s digest time)
#   - Strong refugia (0.85) protecting prey in resource-rich areas
#   - Density-dependent predator reproduction (K=200) preventing runaway boom
#   - Predator cap (max_pred=30) limiting peak predator numbers
#
# Observed dynamics (no artificial floors needed):
#   - Prey oscillate ~50-500+ with long cycles (~1000s period)
#   - Predators oscillate ~3-30
#   - Classic predator-prey cycle: high pred → low prey → low pred → prey recovery
#   - Self-sustaining without min_predators or min_prey floors
# =============================================================================

# Large starting population with very few predators
population:
  initial: 300
  predator_spawn_chance: 0.02 # ~6 predators to start
  min_predators: 0            # No artificial floor - naturally stable
  min_prey: 0                 # No artificial floor - naturally stable
  max_pred: 30                # Cap prevents extreme peaks

# Slower hunting pace with more forgiving prey economics
energy:
  predator:
    digest_time: 3.0          # Longer cooldown between kills
  prey:
    base_cost: 0.010          # Lower metabolism - easier survival
    forage_rate: 0.080        # Much faster foraging

# Strong protection in resource areas
refugia:
  strength: 0.85              # High protection in resource-rich areas

# Slower resource drift - prey can still forage but must move
resource:
  update_interval: 60         # Update every second - slower drift

# Breeding control with density dependence
reproduction:
  prey_threshold: 0.55        # Low threshold - prey can breed when doing okay
  pred_cooldown: 20.0         # Slow predator breeding to prevent initial boom
  pred_threshold: 0.92        # High threshold - must be well-fed to breed
  pred_density_k: 200         # Stronger density dependence
                              # At 200 prey: 50% prob, at 100 prey: 33%
